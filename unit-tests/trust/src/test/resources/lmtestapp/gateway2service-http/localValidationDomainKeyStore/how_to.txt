This stspub.jks has been created from sts.jks used in picketlink-sts.war and store password 
has been changed to "keypass".
For security domains with keystores, the password for the store and for the key has to be 
the same.
Otherwise org.jboss.security.plugins.JaasSecurityDomain is not able to use public key.
